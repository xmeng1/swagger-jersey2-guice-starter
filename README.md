## Introduction

This project is migrated from the official swagger sample repository. There are several issues for the sample of Jersey2-Guice projects. So this project just fix these issues and upgrade the version of dependencies.

## How tu use

The use is very simple, because I have integrated the several configuration of Jetbrain. After clone or download the package, just use Jetbrain Intellij open the folder and there will two Run Configuration.

1. clean and jetty:run : will run clean/compile/war/jetty:run
2. jetty:run: just jetty:run

So first time, you can use the first configuration to run. And then visit http://localhost:8002, you will see the Swagger-UI page.

You can try the Get Pet API, input id: 1, and you will get some output with Cat object.

You can also debug with the Run Configuration.
